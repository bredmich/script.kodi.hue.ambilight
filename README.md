script.kodi.hue.ambilight
=========================

A Kodi add-on that controls Philips Hue lights. In "Theater mode" the add-on dims the the Philips Hue lights as soon as a movie starts playing, and turns the lights back on once the movie is done. "Ambilight mode" turns your Philips Hue lights in a room-sized ambilight.

Support
-------
This is a side project for me, and as such I'll update it when and if I have time . I'll happily respond to issues and feature requests (provided that they are detailed enough to realistically debug your problem (**LOGS**)). Since this is based on @cees-elzinga's original work, I've only modified some of the functions to enhance the features. I don't personally use the ambilight feature, and therefore havent done much testing with it... Again, happy to try and help out, but don't expect super-quick responses!

Please fork and enhance! Pull requests welcome!

Debugging
---------
Please turn on Debug Logging through the addon (Configure -> Advanced Settings -> Debug Logging) and follow the procedure at http://kodi.wiki/view/Log_file/Easy to upload a log file. Provide a link to your logfile in the issue.

Installation
------------

The add-on depends on the Kodi add-on "requests" for the ambilight mode.

**Kodi add-on script.module.requests**

 - Download the add-on as a ZIP file from https://github.com/beenje/script.module.requests
  - (Right click on the "ZIP" icon and select "Download Linked File").
 - Open Kodi
 - Go to `System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file`
 - Select the zip file.

**Kodi add-on script.kodi.hue.ambilight**

 - Download the add-on as a ZIP file from the top of this page
   - (Right click on the "ZIP" icon and select "Download Linked File")
 - Open Kodi
 - Go to `System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file`
 -  Restart Kodi and configure the add-on:
   - `System -> Settings -> Add-ons -> Enabled add-ons -> Services -> Kodi Philips Hue`
   - Run `Start auto discovery of bridge IP and User`.

Note for Raspberry Pi users:

 - Save the add-on configuration by exiting Kodi before shutting down the Pi completely
 - Ambilight mode doesn't work on a Raspberry Pi due to the way it renders video

TODO:
-----

  * Fix: lights may turn on if they are already off, need better state checking
  * Add: setting to customize what is considered a "short" video
  * Add: *experimental* auto undim when movie reaches credits (does not always work, may ruin your movie-watching experience)
  * Refactor: clean up a lot of the old code that's still in the addon, but not necessary
  * Add: [OpenHAB](http://github.com/openhab/openhab) support for a grouped switch endpoint (to turn off a set of lights that are controlled by something other than Philips Hue... i.e. Z-Wave)
  * Publish: get addon onto the official Kodi addon repository
